# Todo!
# README

This is likely one of the first elements users will see when they view your package details page on NuGet.org and Github and is essential to making a good impression!

## What should my README file include?

• An introduction to what your package is and does - what problems does it solve?
• How to get started with your package - are there any specific requirements?
• Links to more comprehensive documentation if not included in the readme itself.
• At least a few code snippets/samples or example images.
• Where and how to leave feedback such as link to the project issues, Twitter, bug tracker, or other platform.
• How to contribute, if applicable.
